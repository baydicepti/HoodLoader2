Vengeance Producer Suite Philta XL offers high quality filters with up to 96 dB cutoff, which means you can create very steep and precise filter curves.

To use Vengeance Producer Suite Philta XL, you simply insert it on any track or bus that you want to process. You can then adjust the filter type, cutoff, resonance, and width of each band. You can also activate the band pass or notch mode for a phaser effect. Next, you can modulate the filter cutoff with the LFOs and envelope followers. You can choose the LFO shape, rate, phase, and depth for each band. You can also set the envelope follower source frequency, attack, release, and depth for each band. Finally, you can add some extra flavor with the saturation, ring modulator, and bitcrusher effects.
  
Vengeance Producer Suite Philta XL is a great plugin for adding some spice and movement to your mixes.

In this section, we will show you some examples of how to use Vengeance Producer Suite Philta XL to create different filter effects on your tracks. We will use a simple drum loop as our source material, and we will apply Philta XL on a send bus. You can download the drum loop and the Philta XL presets from [here](https://www.vengeance-sound.com/plugins.php?sub=Vengeance%20Producer%20Suite%20Philta%20XL&issue=DOWNLOADS).
  
## Example 1: Wobble Bass
  
One of the most popular filter effects in EDM is the wobble bass, which is created by modulating the filter cutoff with a low frequency oscillator (LFO). To create this effect with Philta XL, we will use the following settings:

- Filter type: 24 dB low pass
- Cutoff: 100 Hz
- Resonance: 50%
- Width: 100%
- LFO1 shape: sine
- LFO1 rate: 1/8
- LFO1 phase: 0%
- LFO1 depth: 100%
- LFO2 shape: off
- Env1 source frequency: off
- Env2 source frequency: off
- Saturation: off
- Ring modulator: off
- Bitcrusher: off
- Limiter: on

With these settings, we get a wobble bass effect that syncs with the tempo of our drum loop. You can hear the result below:

## Example 2: Sweep Filter
  
Another common filter effect in EDM is the sweep filter, which is created by automating the filter cutoff over time. To create this effect with Philta XL, we will use the following settings:

- Filter type: 24 dB high pass
- Cutoff: 20 Hz
- Resonance: 50%
- Width: 100%
- LFO1 shape: off
- LFO2 shape: off
- Env1 source frequency: off
- Env2 source frequency: off
- Saturation: off
- Ring modulator: off
- Bitcrusher: off
- Limiter: on

With these settings, we get a sweep filter effect that starts from a low frequency and gradually rises to a high frequency. We can automate the cutoff parameter with our DAW to control the speed and direction of the sweep. You can hear the result below:

## Example 3: Stutter Filter
  
A more creative filter effect that can add some spice and variation to your tracks is the stutter filter, which is created by modulating the filter cutoff with a fast and irregular LFO. To create this effect with Philta XL, we will use the following settings:

- Filter type: 48 dB band pass
- Cutoff: 500 Hz
- Resonance: 75%
- Width: 50%
- LFO1 shape: random
- LFO1 rate: 1/16T (triplet)
- LFO1 phase: 0%
- LFO1 depth: 100%
- LFO2 shape: random
- LFO2 rate: 1/32D (dotted)
- LFO2 phase: 0%
- LFO2 depth: 100%
- Env1 source frequency: off
- Env2 source frequency: off
- Saturation: on (tube)
- Ring modulator: on (10 Hz)
- Bitcrusher: on (8 bits)
