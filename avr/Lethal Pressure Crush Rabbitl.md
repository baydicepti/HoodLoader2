The first study investigates the methods of herring extraction and evaluates the quality and yield of the products. The second study examines the pressure distribution in tablet ing, which is a process of compressing powders into solid forms. The third study explores the experimental crush syndrome, which is a condition caused by prolonged compression of muscles and nerves. The fourth study analyzes the effect of rabbit testicular fluid on the survival and recovery of mice exposed to lethal doses of gamma radiation. The fluid is introduced into the mice as a supplementary treatment after irradiation.
  
The methods of herring extraction include salting, smoking, drying, and canning. The quality and yield of the products depend on various factors such as the freshness of the fish, the salt concentration, the temperature and humidity of the environment, and the duration of the process. The paper compares the chemical and sensory properties of the products and discusses the optimal conditions for each method.

The pressure distribution in tablet ing affects the mechanical strength and uniformity of the tablets. The paper measures the pressure distribution using a pressure-sensitive film and a force transducer. The paper also investigates the influence of different parameters such as the powder composition, the die geometry, the punch speed, and the lubrication on the pressure distribution. The paper proposes a mathematical model to predict the pressure distribution based on these parameters.

The experimental crush syndrome is induced by applying a constant load on the hind limbs of rats for several hours. The paper evaluates the physiological and biochemical changes in the rats after the compression and after the release of the load. The paper also examines the effects of different treatments such as fluid resuscitation, vasodilators, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory drugs on the outcome of the rats. The paper aims to provide insights into the pathophysiology and management of crush syndrome in humans.
  
The effect of rabbit testicular fluid on the survival and recovery of mice exposed to lethal doses of gamma radiation is investigated in this paper. The fluid is obtained from the testes of healthy rabbits and injected into the mice intraperitoneally after irradiation. The paper evaluates the survival rate, the body weight, the hematological parameters, and the histological changes in the mice. The paper also compares the effect of the fluid with that of other substances such as saline, serum, and plasma. The paper suggests that the fluid has a protective and regenerative effect on the irradiated mice.
  
In conclusion, this paper presents the results of four studies on different topics related to herring processing, tablet manufacturing, and radiation effects. The paper provides valuable information and insights for the improvement and optimization of these processes and treatments. The paper also identifies some limitations and challenges for future research.
