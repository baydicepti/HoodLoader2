- Way Station Zeta (4 player map) â This installation sits high above the surface of Gradius IV. Decommissioned after the Seraphim invasion, it served as a staging area for Cybran forces during the Infinite War.
- Rigs (4 player map) â Many years ago, people harvested organic fuel from pockets beneath the seas of Pegasus II. Companies erected massive rigs that now sit on the surface of the water. It takes a cunning balance of sea and air to control the mass that remains on these ancient platforms.
- Etched Desert (8 player map) â As water on this desolate landscape receded due to decades of environmental exploitation on its surface, mass rich deposits were discovered among the remaining eroded mesas. With plenty of area to explore and hide, the battles here have raged for millennia.
- Desolatia (2 player map) â This tiny island can be found in the most remote parts of the Hermetic Seas on Trexxa VI. Its average seasonal temperatures reach well below zero, making it uninhabitable by humans. Its mass deposits, however, give it unparalleled military value.
- Seraphim Isles (8 player map) â The Isles were discovered by a second group of settlers who made contact with the alien Seraphim race. Legend has it that the two coexisted for many years; others claim the Seraphim eliminated them on sight. Nothing remains today of either race but the mountain in the center of the primary island holds a forgotten mystery for Coalition scientists.
- Igneous (6 player map) â The islands called Igneous were named for their strange rock formations. They remain one of the more "alien" regions on Rigel II, and one of the less popular areas for colonizing even though they're rich in mass deposits.
- QAI Labs (2 player map) â Located high above the surface of Pollux IV, this is one of the many test environments used by noted technology company Quantum Visionworks, a division of QAI Industries.
- Tourneydome (8 player map) â Among relics of a city that stretches to the horizons lies an arena where the Coalition's best do battle. A system long abandoned by the Coalition, when commanders enter, only one leaves.

## New Units
 
The DLC Infinite War Battle Pack also adds new units for each faction, including experimentals that can turn the tide of war. Here is a list of each unit and its description:
